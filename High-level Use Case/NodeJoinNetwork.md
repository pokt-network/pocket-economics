# High-Level Use Case / Node Joining the Network

### Use Case Description
This high-level use case describes a node joining the Pocket Network for the first time. <br/>

See below for questions and answers. <br/>

### Pre-Conditions
The potential node does not have an account in the Pocket Network and therefore is not an active node in the Pocket Network. <br/>

### Post-Conditions
The node is now an active node in the Pocket Network with an account and some amount of POKT staked. The node is able to dispatch, service, and will have a chance to produce a block. <br/>

### Actors
Potential Node, Node, Terminal, System <br/>

### User Story
I am a potential node that would like to join the Pocket Network to service relays and earn rewards. I would like the opportunity to produce a block and gain the block reward. <br/>

1. Potential node opens terminal.
2. Potential node enters in (undefined) information.
3. System acknowledges node.
4. Node stakes the minimum required POKT.

### Questions
1. When can I join? <br/>
	A) You can stake the minimum required amount of POKT anytime, once you have staked the minimum amount you are a node in the Pocket Network.
2. How long do I need to wait to become an active node? <br/>
	A) There is no waiting period, just the minimum POKT requirement.
3. Do I have to stake more than once? <br/>
	A) Maybe, the amount of POKT required that needs to be staked in your account at all times could be changed by the DAO. It is important that you check-in on the forum for current requirements. 
4. What is karma? <br/>
	A) Karma is a reputation based system that allows the protocol to track good behavior.
4. How do I earn karma? <br/>
	A) Karma is based on several criteria; how long have you been staked in the network, how much you have staked in the network, creating a session, being active in a completed session, and confirming simple transfer transactions. 
5. When do I receive karma rewards? <br/>
	A) After the third eon your account will be credited with the earned karma at the end of every eon.
6. How do I earn POKT rewards and how much can I earn? <br/>
	A) You earn POKT by; creating a session, being active in a completed session, confirming simple transfer transactions, or producing blocks.<br/>
	A) POKT rewards are directly proportional to your karma until you have reached "aged node" status at which point you will receive the maximum amount of POKT for work done.
7. What if I produce a block, do I get the full reward even if I am very new to the network? <br/>
	A) Yes, as a block producer you will receive the full POKT amount available from that block.
8. When do I receive the POKT reward? <br/>
	A) After the third eon your wallet will be credited with the earned POKT at the end of every era.
9. How do I become a block producer and how do I increase my chances to produce more blocks. <br/>
	A) Once you join the Pocket Network and stake the minimum amount of POKT you are automatically added to the pool of block producers. Your chances to produce the next block are proportional to the amount of POKT you have staked, the more POKT you stake, the higher chance you have of producing the next block.
10. There seems to be a waiting period for me to receive my earned karma and POKT, why? <br/>
	A) Once you join the Pocket Network there is a three eon delay before you receive your earned karma and POKT. This delay is security feature of the network.
